[Try it out!](2048-web.vercel.app)

Game controls:  <br>
W -> moves the board upwards <br>
A -> moves the board to the left  <br>
S -> moves the board downwards  <br>
D -> moves the board to the right  <br>

This simple project helped me pratice my web development skills, as well as some basic programming logic in JavaScript.

I learned a about react states, components, useEffects and detecting keyboard inputs. Practiced handling multidemsional arrays and using the Set built-in data structure in JavaScript. Also learned about CSS basic animations and transitions.
